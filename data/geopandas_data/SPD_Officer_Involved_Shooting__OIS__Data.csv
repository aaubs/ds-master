The subject accessed a firearm from the floor of the vehicle he was occupying and fled on foot, toward the front of the residence and the waiting SPD detective. The detective observed a firearm in the hand of the subject and yelled “Gun!” then “Seattle Police!” The subject raised the firearm toward the detective and the detective fired several rounds, striking the subject. A DOC Community Corrections Specialist (CCS) also fired on the subject, believing they had observed the subject fire on the SPD detective. Two spent casings were found at the scene, believed to be fired by the subject at the task force.
The subject was hit multiple times and fell onto the lawn. Aid was rendered at the scene and the subject was transported to Harborview Medical Center, where he was treated and released into the custody of the Washington State DOC.

Upon arriving, officers attempted to contact the subject who discharged the firearm, in the driveway of his residence. The subject retreated into his home and refused to surrender to police. Seattle Police Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT), Hostage Negotiation Team (HNT), K9 and mutual aid resources from the King County Sheriff’s Officer responded to the now barricaded subject. Over the next six hours, the subject made various threats to fire on officers. At approximately 3:30 AM, after several hours of negotiations, SWAT began tactical operations to encourage the subject to surrender, including the use of Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) gas or pepper gas. At approximately 4:20 A.M., SWAT, one Sergeant and two officers, approached the residence in an armored vehicle known as a Bearcat, to deploy the gas. As they approached, the subject opened fire with a 12-gauge shotgun, striking the bearcat windshield on the driver’s side and the passenger rear view side mirror. A SWAT officer returned fire with a rifle, striking the subject in the hip. The subject retreated into the residence. OC gas was deployed into the residence, with no effect. Bellevue Police Department (BPD) SWAT and the Arson Bomb Squad (ABS) were requested as additional resources. After it was apparent the OC gas was not effective, SWAT deployed chlorobenzylidene malononitrile or CS gas, also known as “tear gas”, still with no effect. At approximately 5:20 A.M., a remote-controlled police robot was maneuvered to the front door and was used to communicate with the subject. After several minutes, the subject surrendered, and an arrest team was able to take him into custody. 
Aid was provided on scene and the subject was transported to Harborview Medical Center, where he was treated for his injuries.
The subject was booked into the King County Jail and held on charges of 1st Degree Assault, for firing on the officers in the Bearcat."

The vehicle was marked with emergency lights activated to signal the stop. The stop was conducted based on an observed illegal lane change. Additionally, a check of the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL) system, indicated the registered owner of the vehicle had a “suspended / revoked” license. The driver of the vehicle complied with the traffic stop, pulling into a parking lot. As the vehicle came to a stop, the male driver attempted to exit the vehicle. Officers instructed the subject to remain in the vehicle and he complied. On initial contact with the occupants of the vehicle (a male driver and female passenger), officers determined the driver was not the registered owner the of vehicle and was not carrying identification but provided a name and date of birth. The officers returned to their vehicle to conduct a records check and determined the information provided by the driver was false. The officers requested additional units and two additional two-officer units arrived, as backup. Shortly after backup arrived, the driver fled the vehicle on foot, clutching the front of his sweatshirt with his right hand in a manner which lead officers to believe he was in possession of a weapon. All six officers pursued the subject across several lanes of traffic and into the 900 block of North 96th Street, where an officer used a takedown to bringing the subject to the ground. During the takedown a firearm fell from the subject, onto the ground. Officers continued to struggle to bring the subject into the prone position and control his hands.

One officer attempted a brace contact shot from their firearm, against the subject’s forearm but the firearm was out of battery (a condition in which the firearm will not discharge). Another officer placed his firearm against the subject’s head and attempted, several times, a brace contact shot. The firearm was again, out of battery and did not discharge.

As officers converged on the parking garage, one Seattle Police Officer observed a subject on an upper deck of the garage discharge a handgun in the direction of officers and pedestrians below. The officer fired two rounds at the subject, who ducked down, out of sight. When the subject returned to a standing position, the firearm was no-longer visible. Other officers established cover and continued the response. A short time later, officers stopped a vehicle attempting to exit the garage and detained three subjects. The driver admitted he was in possession of a handgun. A passenger of the vehicle had a gunshot wound to the lower leg. Officers investigating an assault, nearby, recovered private video showing a physical altercation between the occupants of the vehicle and other subjects. During this altercation, the driver was observed discharging a firearm, in the direction of the wounded subject. Bodyworn Video and statements made by the officer who fired on the subject, suggest the officer did not fire on the subject who was wounded. Additionally, the subject the officer fired upon was only visible from the waist up. The subjects’ legs were not visible or in the line of fire of the officer.
The subject was charged with felony assault. Statements made by the subject to Homicide Detectives conducting follow-up, indicated the subject was unaware he had been fired on by police and was only made aware, after the fact. 
Through the force investigation it appears the man fired at an unidentified subject and was himself shot and wounded by another party. SPD officers saw the man fire his gun and fired at him, but forensic analysis, including the trajectory of officers’ rounds found in a nearby building and a walkway obscuring the man’s lower extremities from officers’ line of fire—indicates his wounds were not caused by officers’ gunfire."

Three Seattle Police Officers responded and attempted contact through the door. The officers identified themselves and ordered the door to be opened. When no response was received, the officers forced entry. Upon entry, the subject was observed, just inside the residence, shirtless, with a knife. Officers, dressed in full uniform, ordered the subject to drop the knife and surrender. The subject refused to comply and advanced on the officers. Two officers fired ten rounds, striking the subject. Officers cleared the residence and took the subject into custody. At 7:33 P.M., paramedics from the Seattle Fire Department arrived on scene and began rendering aid. 
The subject died at the scene."

While officers were enroute, updated information was received indicating the subject was running east on South Jackson Street and was still discharging the firearm. At approximately 8:12 P.M., officers located a subject matching the description in the area of 10th Avenue South and South Jackson Street. The subject was crouched on the sidewalk near the intersection. Officers, dressed in full uniform, approached the subject and repeatedly ordered her to “Stop” and show them her hands. The subject, now in the crosswalk, walking toward the officers with a bag and a blanket in her hands, refused to comply with commands to “sit down.” The subject was seen accessing her waistband, before abruptly dropping the bag and the blanket and pivoting away from the officers. Officers observed a handgun in the subject’s hand. The subject turned toward and raised the firearm to point it at the officers. The officers opened fire, striking the subject once, in the shoulder. 
The subject fell to the ground and was taken into custody. Officers rendered aid until paramedics from the Seattle Fire Department arrived and took over care. 
The subject was transported Harborview Medical Center where she was treated for her injuries. The subject was then transferred to the King County Jail and was charged with 2nd Degree Assault, Theft of a Firearm and Unlawful Possession of a Firearm."
