Some definitions that you will find out there.

- Algorithms that learn from data without explicit programming
- Improve performance with experience
- Automatically identify patterns and make decisions



## Types of Machine Learning

1. **Supervised Learning**: Labeled data, predict outcomes
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Unlabeled data, find patterns
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learn through interaction with environment
4. **Self-Supervised Learning**: Generate labels from the data itself

<!--## The Learning Process

 ![Supervised Learning Process](https://sds-aau.github.io/SDS-master/00_media/ml_super_unsuper.png) 


::: {.notes}
Explain each step in the image briefly.
:::-->


## Mathematical Representation I {.smaller}

For a supervised learning problem:

- **Input features**: $X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$
  - A vector of n features for each data point
  - Example: For a house price prediction, $x_1$ could be square meters, $x_2$ number of rooms, etc.

- **Target variable**: $y$
  - The value we're trying to predict
  - Example: The price of the house

## Mathematical Representation II

- **Model function**: $f(X)$
  - The function that maps input features to predictions
  - Example: For linear regression, $f(X) = w_0 + w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n$

- **Parameters**: $\theta$
  - The values the model learns during training
  - Example: In linear regression, $\theta$ would be the weights $(w_0, w_1, ..., w_n)$

## Mathematical Representation III

We aim to find $f(X)$ such that:

$$y \approx f(X; \theta)$$

This means we want our model's predictions $f(X; \theta)$ to be as close as possible to the true values $y$.

::: {.notes}
Explain that the goal of supervised learning is to find the function $f$ and parameters $\theta$ that make the best predictions. You might want to give a concrete example, like predicting house prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.

## Loss Functions {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Mean Squared Error (Regression)

$$MSE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2$$

**Use case**: Regression tasks. Measures how far the predicted values \( $\hat{y_i}$ \) are from the actual values \( $y_i$ \) by averaging the square of the differences. The larger the difference, the higher the penalty, as squaring the difference emphasizes bigger errors.

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Cross-Entropy (Classification)

$$H(p,q) = -\sum_{x}p(x)\log q(x)$$

**Use case**: Classification tasks. Compares the true probability distribution \( $p(x)$ \) (often 0 or 1 for classification) with the predicted probability \( $q(x)$ \). If the predicted probability is far from the true label, it gives a higher penalty. Logarithms are used to give more emphasis to confident but wrong predictions.

:::
::::

::: {.notes}
- **MSE** is used when the output is continuous (e.g., predicting house prices).
- **Cross-Entropy** is used when the output is categorical (e.g., classifying images into cats or dogs).
:::



## Python Code for Loss Functions I {.smaller}


#### Mean Squared Error (MSE)



```python
import numpy as np

# Actual and predicted values
y = np.array([3.5, 2.1, 4.0, 5.5, 6.1, 7.3, 3.9, 4.4, 5.0, 6.7])
y_hat = np.array([3.8, 2.0, 4.2, 5.0, 6.0, 7.5, 3.5, 4.2, 5.1, 6.8])

# Calculate MSE
n = len(y)
mse = (1/n) * np.sum((y - y_hat) ** 2)
```
$$MSE = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2$$




# Model Evaluation and Generalization

## Train-Test Split

- Split data into training and test sets
- Train on training data
- Evaluate on test data
- Helps assess generalization

::: {.notes}
Add a simple diagram to illustrate the split.
:::

## Cross-Validation

- K-fold cross-validation
- Helps in robust model evaluation
- Reduces overfitting

```python
# Example code (not executed)
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)
print(f"Cross-validation scores: {scores}")
print(f"Mean score: {scores.mean():.2f}")
```

::: {.notes}
Explain the benefits and potential drawbacks of cross-validation.
:::

## Python Code for Loss Functions II {.scrollable}


#### Cross-Entropy (Classification)

```python
import numpy as np

# True labels (one-hot encoded) for 3 classes
p = np.array([
    [1, 0, 0],  # Class 1
    [0, 1, 0],  # Class 2
    [0, 0, 1],  # Class 3
    [1, 0, 0],  # Class 1
    [0, 1, 0],  # Class 2
])

# Predicted probabilities for each class (sum of each row should be 1)
q = np.array([
    [0.8, 0.1, 0.1],  # Predicted probabilities for Class 1, 2, 3
    [0.2, 0.7, 0.1],  # Predicted probabilities for Class 1, 2, 3
    [0.1, 0.2, 0.7],  # Predicted probabilities for Class 1, 2, 3
    [0.6, 0.3, 0.1],  # Predicted probabilities for Class 1, 2, 3
    [0.2, 0.6, 0.2],  # Predicted probabilities for Class 1, 2, 3
])

# Clip values to avoid log(0)
q = np.clip(q, 1e-12, 1 - 1e-12)

# Calculate cross-entropy for multiclass classification
cross_entropy = -np.sum(p * np.log(q))

```
$$H(p,q) = -\sum_{x}p(x)\log q(x)$$




## Bias-Variance Tradeoff

- **Bias**: Error from overly simplistic models (underfitting)
- **Variance**: Error from models too sensitive to training data (overfitting)
- **Total Error** = Bias² + Variance + **Irreducible Error**
  
  **Goal:** Find the optimal balance between bias and variance for the lowest possible total error.



This version adds more explanation to bias and variance, and highlights the purpose of the tradeoff.

## Bias-Variance Tradeoff

## Mathematical Representation of Bias-Variance

For a given point $x$, the expected prediction error is:

$$E[(y - \hat{f}(x))^2] = \text{Var}(\hat{f}(x)) + [\text{Bias}(\hat{f}(x))]^2 + \text{Var}(\epsilon)$$

Where:
- $\text{Var}(\hat{f}(x))$ is the variance
- $[\text{Bias}(\hat{f}(x))]^2$ is the squared bias
- $\text{Var}(\epsilon)$ is the irreducible error

Provide a simple interpretation of this equation.

## Regularization: Preventing Overfitting {.scrollable}

- **Overfitting**: When a model is too complex and memorizes training data, leading to poor performance on new data.
- **Regularization**: Technique to balance **model complexity** and **performance**, making the model generalize better.

### Common Regularization Methods:

- **Lasso (L1)**: Sets some coefficients to **zero**, ignoring less important features.
- **Ridge (L2)**: Shrinks all coefficients, but keeps all features.
- **Elastic Net**: Combines both Lasso and Ridge regularization.


### Elastic Net Formula

$$\lambda \sum_{p=1}^{P} [ (1 - \alpha) |\beta_p| + \alpha |\beta_p|^2]$$

- **$\lambda$**: Controls regularization strength
- **$\alpha$**: Balances L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge)


# Popular Model Classes

## Linear Models

1. Linear Regression
   $$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + ... + \beta_nx_n + \epsilon$$

2. Logistic Regression (for binary classification)
   $$P(y=1|X) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n)}}$$

3. Elastic Net
   - Combines L1 and L2 regularization

Add a brief real-world application for each model.

## Tree-based Models

1. Decision Trees
   - Recursive binary splitting
   - Measures: Gini impurity, Information gain

2. Random Forests
   - Ensemble of decision trees
   - Bagging and feature randomness

3. Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost)
   - Sequential ensemble of weak learners
   - Optimizes a differentiable loss function

# Practical Considerations 

## Feature Engineering {.scrollable}

- **Creating relevant features**: Deriving new features to improve model performance.
- **Handling missing data**: Filling or removing incomplete data to ensure a robust model.
- **Scaling and normalization**: Ensuring features are on similar scales for algorithms that rely on distance (e.g., k-NN, SVM).

#### Example: One-Hot Encoding for Categorical Variables

Transforms categorical features into a numerical format that models can understand.

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder

# One-hot encoding example
encoder = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
X_encoded = encoder.fit_transform(X)
```


## Model Selection and Tuning

- Cross-validation
- Hyperparameter optimization (e.g., Grid Search, Random Search)
- Ensemble methods

Example: Grid Search with cross-validation

```python
# Example code (not executed)
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
param_grid = {'C': [0.1, 1, 10], 'kernel': ['rbf', 'linear']}
grid_search = GridSearchCV(svm.SVC(), param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X, y)
```
