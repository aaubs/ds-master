        "  - Both models are proficient in understanding language, syntax, and semantics, with GPT's larger scale model (billions of parameters) excelling in these areas.\n",

        "  - **BERT (Encoder)**: Ideal for classification (e.g., sentiment analysis), question-answering, summarization, and named entity recognition.\n",

        "  - BERT employs the encoder part of the transformer architecture.\n",
        "  - It focuses on understanding semantic and syntactic language information.\n",
        "  - BERT's output consists of embeddings, rather than predicted next words.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Application of Embeddings**:\n",
        "  - To use these embeddings, additional layers (e.g., for text classification or questions and answers) need to be added on top of BERT.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Training Technique**:\n",
        "  - BERT utilizes a unique training method to circumvent the need for expensive labeled data.\n",
        "  - This involves using a technique called Self-Supervised Learning, particularly effective with large data volumes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Masked Language Model**:\n",
        "  - In BERT’s training, sentences are altered by masking words.\n",
        "  - Example: **\"Sarah went to a restaurant to meet her friend that night.\"** becomes **\"Sarah went to a restaurant to meet her MASK that night.\"**\n",
        "  - These masks help BERT generate its own labeled data from originally unlabeled data.\n",

        "  - Decoders are primarily used in generating next words in language tasks such as text translation or story generation.\n",
        "  - The outputs from decoders are words accompanied by their respective probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Use of Attention Mechanisms**:\n",
        "  - Decoders implement the attention concept twice during the model training process.\n",
        "  - Initially, they use Masked Multi-Head Attention, similar to BERT's MASK concept. Here, only the initial words of a target sentence are shown to the model to facilitate learning without 'cheating'.\n",
        "  - Subsequently, the decoder employs Multi-Head Attention, akin to what is used in encoders.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Interaction with Encoders in Transformer Models**:\n",
        "  - In models combining encoders and decoders, there's a technique where the encoder's output (keys and values) is fed into the decoders.\n",
        "  - Decoders use queries to find relevant keys, aiding in tasks like understanding and translating sentences, even with varying word counts and order.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **GPT's Unique Approach**:\n",
        "  - GPT deviates from this technique by using only a decoder.\n",
        "  - Trained on massive datasets (Large Language Model), GPT's knowledge is embedded in billions of parameters.\n",

        "- **Prompt Template**: This provides instructions to the language model. This controls what the language model outputs, so understanding how to construct prompts and different prompting strategies is crucial.\n",

        "- **Memory**: Provides a construct for storing and retrieving messages during a conversation which can be either short term or long term.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Indexes**: Help LLMs interact with documents by providing a way to structure them. LangChain provides Document Loaders to load documents, Text Splitters to split documents into smaller chunks, Vector Stores to store documents as embeddings, and Retrievers to fetch relevant documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Chain**: Probably the most important component of LangChain is the Chain class. It's a wrapper around the LLM that allows you to create a chain of actions.\n",

        "- **Agents**:: Agents are the most powerful feature of LangChain. They allow you to combine LLMs with external data and tools.\n",

            "Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence of machines or software, as opposed to the intelligence of other living beings, primarily of humans. It is a field of study in computer science that develops and studies intelligent machines. Such machines may be called AIs.\n",
            "AI technology is widely used throughout industry, government, and science. Some high-profile applications are: advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix), interacting via human speech (such as Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), generative and creative tools (ChatGPT and AI art), and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (such as chess and Go).Alan Turing was the first person to conduct substantial research in the field that he called Machine Intelligence. Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956. The field went through multiple cycles of optimism followed by disappointment and loss of funding. Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques, and after 2017 with the transformer architecture. This led to the AI spring of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics. General intelligence (the ability to complete any task performable by a human) is among the field's long-term goals.To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics. AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience and other fields.\n"
