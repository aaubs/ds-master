        "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial! In this guide, you'll learn how to build a web application where two intelligent agents discuss economic topics. We'll leverage the Crew AI starter template, integrate FastAPI for the backend, and use Streamlit for the frontend. By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a fully functional web app that allows users to input economic variables and view insightful discussions between the agents.\n",

For instance, if government spending leads to higher inflation, the central bank might increase interest rates to curb excessive demand.
