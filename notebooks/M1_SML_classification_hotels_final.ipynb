        "In the hotel industry, managing bookings is a high-stakes balancing act. A vacant room is lost revenue, but overbooking can lead to angry customers and reputational damage. Booking cancellations are a major source of this uncertainty. A reliable model that predicts which bookings are likely to be canceled can be a game-changer for a hotel's revenue management strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Business Impact:**\n",
        "*   **Optimized Overbooking:** If a hotel can confidently predict cancellations, it can fine-tune its overbooking levels to maximize occupancy without inconveniencing guests.\n",
        "*   **Targeted Marketing:** High-risk bookings could be targeted with gentle reminders or non-refundable upgrade offers to \"lock in\" the reservation.\n",

        "-   **False Positive (Type I Error):** Predicting a cancellation that doesn't happen. The cost is potentially offering an unnecessary discount or irritating a committed customer.\n",
        "-   **False Negative (Type II Error):** Failing to predict a cancellation that does happen. The cost is lost revenue from an unexpectedly empty room.\n",
